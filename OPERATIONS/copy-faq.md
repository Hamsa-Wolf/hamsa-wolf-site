# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### Component: WhatIsHamsaWolf
#### What exactly is HamsaWolf?

We're a Sales Engineering and Systems Architecture agency. We build fully custom business operating systems for companies that have outgrown off-the-shelf tools. Think of us as the architects and engineers who build your business its own custom software infrastructure.

### Component: HowDifferent
#### How is this different from just using Salesforce or HubSpot?

Those are templates you configure. We build from scratch. Salesforce forces you into their data model, their workflows, their limitations. We build YOUR data model, YOUR workflows, with zero limitations. You own the code. You own the infrastructure. No subscriptions, no forced updates, no features you don't use.

### Component: WhatIsCustomOS
#### What do you mean by "custom business OS"?

A business operating system is the core infrastructure that runs your company's operations. Instead of duct-taping together 15 different SaaS tools, we build you one unified system with custom modules for exactly what you need: intake, CRM, scheduling, communication, automation, reporting — all built specifically for how you work.

## Pricing Questions

### Component: WhyNotCheaper
#### Why not just use cheaper SaaS tools?

Add up what you're spending on CRM, scheduling, automation, communication, and reporting tools. Now add the cost of integration tools. Now add the time lost to manual data entry and tool-switching. Our custom systems typically pay for themselves in 6 months through efficiency alone — and you OWN them forever.

### Component: HiddenCosts
#### Are there hidden costs?

No. Our pricing is transparent. The only additional costs would be hosting (typically $50-200/month depending on scale) and any optional add-on modules you choose. No subscription fees to us after your system is built.

### Component: CanStartSmall
#### Can we start with Blueprint and upgrade later?

Absolutely. Many clients start with the $3,500 Blueprint to understand exactly what they need, then use that as the specification for their Custom System Build. The Blueprint fee is credited toward your Build if you proceed within 30 days.

## Technical Questions

### Component: WhoOwnsCode
#### Who owns the code and infrastructure?

You do. 100%. We build it, you own it. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary licenses, no ongoing fees to access your own system. You can modify it, extend it, or hire anyone else to work on it.

### Component: Maintenance
#### What about maintenance and updates?

Your custom system is built to be self-maintaining for day-to-day operations. For ongoing optimization and expansion, our System Command package provides continuous improvement for $4,500/month. But it's optional — many clients manage their systems independently after launch.

### Component: DataMigration
#### How do you handle data migration from our existing tools?

We build custom migration scripts as part of every System Build. We'll extract your data from existing tools, clean it, restructure it for your new system, and import it. Your historical data comes with you.

### Component: WhatTech
#### What technology do you use?

We use modern, proven technologies tailored to each client's needs. Typically this includes cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), modern frameworks (React/Vue for UI), Python or Node.js for backend logic, and enterprise-grade databases. All mainstream, well-supported technologies — no exotic dependencies.

## Process Questions

### Component: HowLong
#### How long does it take?

- **Blueprint**: 7-10 business days
- **Custom System Build**: 21-45 days depending on complexity
- **System Command**: Ongoing 90-day partnership

We move fast because we're not modifying existing software — we're building exactly what you need from day one.

### Component: WhoInvolved
#### Who needs to be involved from our team?

For the Blueprint, we need 3-5 hours with key stakeholders who understand your operations. For the Build, we need a designated point person for weekly check-ins and feedback. For training, we'll need your full team for 2-4 hours.

### Component: WhatIfProcessChanges
#### What if our processes change after the system is built?

That's expected. Your custom system is built to evolve. Simple changes your team can make. Significant expansions can be handled through our System Command partnership or as one-off projects. The system is yours to modify as needed.

## Results Questions

### Component: Guarantees
#### Do you guarantee results?

Yes. If your custom system doesn't deliver measurable improvement within 30 days of launch, we refund your entire fee. We've never had to honor this because we only build systems that solve real problems.

### Component: References
#### Can you share references or case studies?

We're happy to share sanitized case studies during your discovery call. Our venue client case study shows 63+ events booked in year one after consolidating 7 tools into one custom OS. Every engagement is under NDA, but we can share patterns and outcomes.

### Component: ROI
#### What kind of ROI should we expect?

Most clients see ROI within 6 months through:
- Time saved from eliminated tool-switching (typically 10+ hours/week)
- Increased conversion from faster response times
- Reduced software subscription costs
- Better decision-making from unified data
- Ability to scale without adding overhead

## Getting Started

### Component: NextSteps
#### What are the next steps?

Schedule a free 30-minute discovery call. We'll understand your current chaos, show you relevant examples, and determine if custom infrastructure makes sense for you. No pressure, no sales tactics — just an engineering conversation about solving your operational problems.

### Component: NotReady
#### What if we're not ready for custom systems?

That's fine. Keep our information for when you are. But know that every month you wait is another month of lost efficiency, scattered data, and manual processes. The best time to build proper infrastructure was when you started. The second best time is now.

### Component: Contact
