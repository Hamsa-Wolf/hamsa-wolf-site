## Implementation Notes for Claude Code

1. **Read OPERATIONS.md first** - It's the law
2. **Parse audit files** if available (from XTRACTR)
3. **Generate three HTML files**: index.html, privacy.html, terms.html
4. **Include footer** with legal links on all pages
5. **Use token-based CSS** with variables
6. **Never use placeholder content** - all copy is provided
7. **Follow ASSET-MIGRATION.md** for asset organization
8. **Integrate HWLOGO.png** and favicon setup
9. **Update CHANGELOG** after each build
