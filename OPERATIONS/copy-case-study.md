## Case Study Content

### Component: StartingPoint
#### Starting Point

A premium event venue with incredible word-of-mouth was drowning in its own success. The owner-operator managed inquiries across three email accounts, handwritten notebooks, and memory. Follow-ups happened when remembered. Deals were won through heroic individual effort.

**The tool chaos:**
- Gmail for inquiries (3 different accounts)
- Google Sheets for tracking (never updated)
- Calendly for tours (but also phone scheduling)
- Square for payments (disconnected from everything)
- WhatsApp for client communication
- Notebook for "real" pipeline tracking
- Memory for follow-ups

Seven tools. Zero integration. Every deal requiring manual data entry across multiple systems.

The business was successful despite its systems, not because of them.

### Component: WhatWeBuilt
#### What We Built

Over 6 weeks, we built them a completely custom business operating system using Hamsa Wolf architecture.

**The custom system included:**
- **Unified Intake Module** — All inquiries flow to one place, regardless of source
- **Custom CRM Layer** — Built specifically for venue sales, not generic B2B
- **AI Communication Agent** — Responds to inquiries, qualifies leads, schedules tours
- **Smart Scheduling Module** — Availability, tour routing, automated confirmations
- **Dynamic Pricing Engine** — Custom logic for packages, seasons, and add-ons
- **Pipeline Intelligence** — Real-time forecasting and capacity planning
- **Automated Workflows** — Follow-ups, contracts, payments, all connected

No templates. No subscriptions to manage. Just one unified system built exactly for how they sell.

### Component: Results
#### Results

The transformation was immediate and measurable. Within the first year of running the new system:

**Key Metrics:**
- **63+ events** booked through the new pipeline
- **6 bookings** closed in a single open-house sprint
- **1-call close** framework for qualified leads
- **72-hour** average response time to 20 minutes
- **40% increase** in average event value
- **Owner freed** from day-to-day sales

### Component: ImpactStatement

This engagement proved our thesis: businesses don't need more tools, they need the RIGHT tools — built specifically for them.

The venue now runs on infrastructure they own. No subscription fees. No forced updates. No features they don't use. Just a custom business OS that works exactly how they work, maintained and evolved by their own team.

## Testimonial

### Component: ClientQuote

> "Before HamsaWolf, I was drowning in tools that didn't talk to each other. Every booking touched seven different systems. Now everything runs through our custom OS — from first inquiry to final payment. The 63 events we booked? That happened because we stopped fighting with software and started selling. HamsaWolf didn't just build us a system, they built us infrastructure we actually own."
