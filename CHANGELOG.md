## [2.0.0] - 2024-12-27

### Changed - MAJOR VALUE PROPOSITION UPDATE

#### Complete Repositioning
- Shifted from "sales engineering consulting" to **"Sales Engineering and Systems Architecture agency"**
- Core value prop: **"Your business deserves infrastructure that works as hard as you do"**
- Now positioning as builders of **fully custom business operating systems**
- Emphasis on **replacing duct-tape software with custom-built business OS**
- **NOT templates, NOT CRMs** - but entirely bespoke modules using Hamsa Wolf architecture

#### New Service Structure
- **System Blueprint** - $3,500 (diagnostic and architecture plan)
- **Custom System Build** - Starting at $12,500 (fully custom business OS)
- **System Command** - $4,500/month (90-day embedded architect partnership)
- Added optional **Add-On Modules** with transparent pricing

#### Updated Messaging
- Primary differentiator: Custom infrastructure vs. SaaS subscriptions
- "From duct-tape to architecture" philosophy
- Ownership model: Clients own their infrastructure, no vendor lock-in
- AI-powered tools built into core, not bolted on

#### Content Updates
- Rewrote all copy files to reflect custom system building
- Updated case study to show tool consolidation (7 tools → 1 custom OS)
- Modified client segments to focus on tool chaos and unique workflows
- Changed CTAs from "strategy calls" to "discovery calls"
- Added package comparison tables and pricing transparency

### Technical Decisions
- Hamsa Wolf Architecture as proprietary system
- Focus on bespoke module engineering
- AI agents trained on client-specific logic
- Custom data models for each business
