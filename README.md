# HamsaWolf Sales Engineering Website

## Project Overview

This repository contains the website for HamsaWolf Sales Engineering, a boutique Sales Engineering and Systems Architecture agency that builds fully custom business operating systems for growing companies.

## Architecture

This website is built using a **documentation-driven development** approach where:

1. **Raw assets** are processed through XTRACTR to create audit files
2. **Audit files** provide design tokens and component patterns
3. **OPERATIONS documents** define all content and build instructions
4. **Claude Code** assembles the final website from these sources

## Directory Structure

## Build Process

The website generation follows this pipeline:

1. **Input Processing**: XTRACTR processes Raw HTML files into Audit JSON
2. **Token Extraction**: Design tokens derived from Audit data
3. **Content Loading**: All copy loaded from OPERATIONS/*.md files
4. **HTML Assembly**: Components assembled with injected content
5. **Asset Generation**: CSS and JS files created
6. **Output**: Complete website in src/ directory

## Key Principles

- **Single Source of Truth**: All content lives in OPERATIONS/copy-*.md
- **Token-Based Design**: Design system derived from audit data
- **Component Architecture**: Reusable HTML patterns
- **Documentation-Driven**: OPERATIONS.md defines all behavior
- **AI-Buildable**: Entire site can be regenerated by Claude Code

## Content Management

To update website content:

1. Edit the appropriate file in `OPERATIONS/copy-*.md`
2. Run the build process (via Claude Code)
3. Deploy the updated `src/` directory

Never edit `src/index.html` directly - all changes should flow through the OPERATIONS files.

## Design System

The design system is automatically extracted from audit files and includes:

- **Colors**: Primary, secondary, and neutral scales
- **Typography**: Heading and body font stacks with size scale
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing units (4px base)
- **Components**: Buttons, cards, sections, CTAs

## Service Packages
